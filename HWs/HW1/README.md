Converting Dataframes into Dictionaries
Memory mapping huge datasets

Perhaps the single biggest memory management problem with pandas is the requirement that data must be loaded completely into RAM to be processed. pandas's internal BlockManager is far too complicated to be usable in any practical memory-mapping setting [Links](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/)

 Input Injection
     Module injection — It occurs when a malicious Python module or package file is imported into a directory.
    SQL injection — It involves introducing malicious input that is executed in the context of SQL statements.
    Command injection — It occurs when calling a process, subprocess, or os.system. Specially crafted variables can contain malicious values, which introduce vulnerabilities when called in local commands.
