 Input Injection
     Module injection — It occurs when a malicious Python module or package file is imported into a directory.
    SQL injection — It involves introducing malicious input that is executed in the context of SQL statements.
    Command injection — It occurs when calling a process, subprocess, or os.system. Specially crafted variables can contain malicious values, which introduce vulnerabilities when called in local commands.
